# Contributing
1. Choose an issue to work on (**not a multi-issue**)
2. You should be assigned to this issue - see [assignment procedure details](#assigning-contributors-to-issues)
3. Fork repository (or pull latest changes if you have forked it previously), implement issue in your forked repository
4. Create pull request (single pull request per issue), reference issue in pull request
5.  Someone with write access (currently organization owner @kzhereb ) reviews pull requests, either accepts it, or comments on what should be changed
6. (Optional) Other contributors can also review pull request and comment on it (procedure TBD)
7.  Pull request gets integrated into main repository, and issue gets closed

# Assigning contributors to issues
1. In each student group, there is (at least) one student with Triage rights to repository; this student can assign contributors to issues
2. At the end of each practice lesson, we discuss issue assignments and some students get assigned to issues
3. If you want to work on some unassigned issue between lessons (and don't want to wait until next lesson) - please post a message in Telegram group. If there are no objections - you will be assigned to this issue.
4. If you want to work on some issue and there is already assignee - please contact them. You can work on issues together, but assignee is responsible for coordinating your contribution.
